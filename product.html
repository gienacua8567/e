In fact, scientific studies have suggested that running may have played a role in human evolution. Evidence shows that one of the significant leaps of man’s evolution was when he departed from being a “tree-swinger” to a “wayfarer”. This was the period were man transitioned from being gatherers to hunters. He’s been doing it since. So in that aspect alone, we can see that running is deeply rooted in man’s way of life.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Jump forward two million years… </strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Running is still very much a part of our way of life. We might not be utilizing this ability to literally hunt for food anymore but rather relatively to go about and do our work to earn enough to buy food. Well, not so much really has changed since then after all. You still move about to put food on the table. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Ok so, we now know that the appeal of running is partly “genetic”. What else is there? Well, man evolved further and has now become a complicated creature with a complicated lifestyle. Unfortunately, in so doing running was not a part of his way of life anymore. Man has gone to become a more sedentary creature and no longer runs as inherently as before. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Nowadays, running has been transformed into a more discretionary activity. You do it when you feel like it; or when you realize you need to do it to help upkeep your fitness. So then you’d try to find inspiration to try to do it regularly. Now it becomes a venue for socialization. And that’s the single best reason people felt encouraged to run more voluntarily. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Admit it. Running to socialize is more fun than running to simply upkeep your fitness. So now that running is done collectively, more and more people are encouraging everyone to do it. It’s not difficult to convince most people because again -- running is in our blood. And soon enough this collective movement unites like-minded people that consider running as part of their way of life. Thus, becoming a lifestyle.
